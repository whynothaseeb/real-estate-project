My Responsive Portfolio Website
This project is a modern, responsive portfolio website built with React and styled using Tailwind CSS. It features a dynamic header, a projects section with an interactive slider, and a testimonials section with engaging hover effects.

Technologies Used

Tailwind CSS: A utility-first CSS framework for rapidly building custom designs.

Features
Responsive Navigation Bar:

Adapts layout for different screen sizes.

Hamburger menu for mobile view with smooth slide-in/out animation.

Fixed to the top for easy access.

Dynamic Header Section:

Full-screen background image.

Responsive heading text that adjusts size based on the viewport.

Call-to-action buttons with uniform sizing across various screen sizes.

Interactive Projects Slider:

Displays project cards in a carousel format.

Responsive display: 1 card on small screens, 2 on medium, 3 on large.

Smooth transitions between slides.

Hover Effect: Project detail cards slide down to reveal more of the image, and the entire card scales up slightly with an enhanced shadow for a "pop out" effect.

Engaging Testimonials Section:

Displays customer feedback in a grid layout.

Hover Effect: Testimonial cards "pop out" by scaling up slightly and gaining a more prominent shadow, creating a visually appealing interaction.

Clean and Modular Code: Organized into reusable React components.
